        <p id="aboutme">
            My name is William Kim, and I am a Sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science! I graduated from Blue Valley Highschool, and I live in 
            Overland Park KS. <br>
            In school, I have taken fundamental coding classes such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Website Development, and Rapid Prototype Development. Outside of Computer 
            Science classes, I enjoy mathematics, especially Calculus and Linear Algebra. <br>
            I have some interesting hobbies. I like to make Youtube videos for my channel BossyBear. I generally make videos on the game Epic Seven, but I have done other 
            videos in the past. I love playing and watching sports. My favorite sports to play are Football, Basketball, and Tennis. I was the Varsity Captian of my highschool 
            tennis team, and I love the Kansas City Chiefs, so most of my childhood was being involved with sports. When I'm not playing sports, I like to read and play video games. 
            The book I enjoy are either martial arts books or fantasy fiction books. I always found the amount of freedom that the author has when writing these kinds of books keeps 
            it interesting. The games I enjoy are Epic Seven, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Mario Party. I am also into rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and Osu!.

            I developed a program in java for Epic Seven players that optimizes the best combinations of equipment 
            for each specific hero. For example, if you want a damage dealing (DPS) hero, then the program would iterate through the pieces of equipment to find the best 
            combination of gear that does the most damage. Each hero in the game has different base stats, so they individually have to be coded into the software in a seperate 
            class. I also created an algorithm to calculate gear score which will give a numerical value for the quality of a piece of gear.

            Another project I created is this website using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I learned the front-end aspect of coding and became more comfortable with HTML 
            and CSS. I used this website to display my goals and projects as well as explain a little bit more about me.

            I also created a website that can aid Mario Party players by tracking star spaces. Star spaces are specific spots on the board 
            where stars can spawn. The trick is that each time the star moves after someone acquires it, the star cannot spawn at a spot that it has already been at 
            unless the star has spawn at every spot. There is much more information on the website itself, so I recommend visiting the website especially if you are 
            about to play Mario Party with your friends!

            Future projects that I am working on is coding a game and learning more about backend programming including 
            work with databases, APIs, and servers.
